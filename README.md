Edit: I created this page when I was 15 and quit school thinking I'd get hired as a programmer by learning it all from scratch in 3 months. I failed but I had fun.
This the website where I'm going to show off my work

Beside you can find the first page that is decent. It's a continuous experiment of different front-end components, features, and tricks >>
